///////
//NEEED TO SEPARATE THE DATA UPDATE MESSAGE FROM THE "RASTER DISPLAY" MESSAGE
//THE DATA UPDATE MESSAGE CANNOT CALL THE RASTER DISPLAY MESSAGE
//  One solution to avoid a "holding" array:
//  incoming arrays are sent to a sequencer that maps their data into SetFreq and SetPan (or whatever)
//  Separately there is a sequencer or loop function that continuously displays all of the grain voices
//	The sequencers can be coordinated so that we do not need a 1:1 mapping of agent data to grain voices
//	--for example the present sequencing uses each grain voice to represent two agents' data values
///////

/*
RasterRefreshRate -- the rate that one set of (10) grain voices is scanned (displayed)
DataRefreshRate -- the rate the new arrays are transmitted from the client. This determines the rate that grain voice parameters are updated.

The current raster plan uses 10 voices to display data values in a rapid sequence. The 10 voices are scanned in series by a sequencer. Agent data values are assigned independently: the idea is to use one raster sequence of 10 voices to display 20 agents' data.

To achieve the 2:1 ratio (10 voices representing 20 agents), the RasterRefreshRate = 2x DataRefreshRate. For example, if a raster scans 10 voices in 0.5 second, then scans a second set of 10 in 0.5 second, the data can update every 1 second. In this scenario the DatRefreshRate should update the second set of data values at the RasterRefreshRate.

The DataRefreshRate pseudocode is something like this:
time 0.0: DataRefresh from client
time 0.0: Map first 10 data values to 10 grain voices
time 0.0: RasterRefresh 10 voices 
time 0.5: Map next 10 data values to 10 grain voices
time 0.5: RasterRefresh 10 voices 
time 1.0: DataRefresh from client
time 1.0: Map first 10 data values to 10 grain voices
time 1.0: RasterRefresh 10 voices 
time 1.5: Map next 10 data values to 10 grain voices
time 1.5: RasterRefresh 10 voices
